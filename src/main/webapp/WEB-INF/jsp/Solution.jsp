      <h2>About the Solution</h2>
      <p>SA solution provider is a vendor, a service provider or a value-added reseller (VAR) that comprehensively handles the project needs of their client from concept to installation through support. This process normally involves studying the client's current infrastructure, evaluating the client's needs, specifying the mix of manufacturers' hardware and software required to meet project goals, installing the hardware and software at the client's site(s). In many cases, the "solution" also includes ongoing service and support from the VAR.</p>
      <p>A turnkey solution provider is slightly different. Rather than customizing a solution for each client, the turnkey provider offers minimal consultation and one or more established product packages that allow only minimal configuration.</p>
